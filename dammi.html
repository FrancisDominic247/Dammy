<h4>Web Design</h4><br>
<p>I'm also into web development</p>
<h4>Cakes and confectionaries</h4>
<p>I love to bake,fry,cook and do things that involves food and eating because i love to eat a lot! Another reason i'm into cooking is because i want to feed people and make sure they are satisfied with whatever they eat and make sure it doesn't cause them indigestion(smiles)</p>
<h4>Music</h4><br>
<p>I also love playing instrument and the two main instrument i play are violin and flute.I started learning violin 3years ago,it was intoduced to me by a friend when i joined the choir in my church.I was reluctant at first because when i started playing it my neck would start to hurt a lot and the violin was very heavy to carry but i got used to it overtime.The flute is also heavy but i adjusted to the weight and now i enjoy playing it for hours.I'll also love to learn more instrument as the time goes by with God's Grace!</p>
